## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- SQLite (included with Python)
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/philip068/probable-giggle.git
cd leetcode-mastery
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Initialize the database:
```sh
python db_init.py
```

"""
Optional but recommended: Seed the database with `add_problems.py` since it uses `sample_problems.py`.
This can speed up CLI readiness for usefulness.
"""

## Usage

### CLI Commands

#### Database Management
Initialize or Reset Database:
```sh
python cli.py reset
```

#### Problem Management
Add a Problem:
```sh
python cli.py problem add
```

Bulk Add Problems:
```sh
python add_problems.py
```

List Problems:
```sh
python cli.py problem list --difficulty Medium --topic Array
```

#### Progress Tracking
View Overall Progress:
```sh
python cli.py view-progress
```

Simulate Problem Mastery (Testing Feature):
** this can be useful to manually alter problem progressions
```sh
python simulate_mastery.py --problem-id <ID> --attempts <NUM> --successes <NUM>
```

#### Visualization
Generate Visual Insights:
```sh
python cli.py visualize
```

#### Daily Scheduler
Get Todayâ€™s Problems:
```sh
python cli.py today
```

### Example Workflows
Add Problems and Track Progress:
```sh
python cli.py problem add
python cli.py view-progress
```

Analyze Weak Topics:
```sh
python cli.py problem list --topic "Dynamic Programming"
python cli.py today
```

Visualize Success Trends:
```sh
python cli.py visualize
```

## Detailed Modules

### Key Modules and Their Roles

#### Database Initialization (`db_init.py`)
- Sets up database schemas for topics, problems, patterns, and progress.
- Handles resetting and re-initializing the database.

#### Problem Management (`add_problems.py`, `list_problems_by_topic.py`)
- Add, list, and validate problems with metadata like patterns, difficulty, and prerequisites.

#### Dynamic Scheduler (`scheduler.py`)
- Implements adaptive scheduling based on spaced repetition and mastery.
- Integrates user performance to prioritize future problems dynamically.

#### Progress Tracker (`view_progress.py`)
- Tracks attempts, successes, hints used, and mastery for every problem.
- Aggregates statistics by topic and difficulty.

#### Visualization Tools (`visualize_progress.py`)
- Generate success trends, topic-wise mastery, and difficulty analysis charts.
- Supports saving graphs for detailed reporting.

#### Configuration Manager (`config.ini`)
- Central repository for adjustable thresholds and weights.

#### Logging Utilities (`logger.py`)
- Ensures every action and error is logged for debugging and review.

## Configuration

Settings can be customized in the `config.ini` file:

### Database Configuration:
```ini
[Database]
db_path = leetcode_mastery.db
```

### Scheduling Settings:
```ini
[Scheduling]
spaced_intervals = 1,3,7,14,30
mastery_threshold_ratio = 0.8
min_attempts_for_mastery = 3
```

### Scoring Weights:
```ini
[Scoring]
difficulty_weight_multiplier = 2
pattern_weight_multiplier = 1.5
frequency_weight_multiplier = 2.0
base_urgency_score = 5.0
attempt_penalty = 0.1
hints_factor = 1.0
topic_priority_offset = 20
```

### Rationale for Configurations

#### Database Path
- **Purpose:** Specifies the location of the SQLite database file to store problems and progress data.
- **Why:** Centralized data management ensures consistency across CLI commands.

#### Scheduling Settings
- **Spaced Intervals:** Defines review intervals (1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days).
   - **Why:** Based on spaced repetition theory to reinforce long-term memory.
- **Mastery Threshold Ratio:** A ratio (e.g., 0.8) indicating the success rate required to master a problem.
   - **Why:** Ensures users consistently succeed before marking problems as mastered.
- **Minimum Attempts for Mastery:** Sets a floor for how many times a problem must be attempted before mastery is considered.
   - **Why:** Prevents premature mastery classification from occasional success.

#### Scoring Weights
- **Difficulty Weight Multiplier:** Increases priority for harder problems.
   - **Why:** Aligns focus with challenging areas to maximize learning impact.
- **Pattern and Frequency Multipliers:** Prioritizes frequent or pattern-rich problems to align with industry trends.
   - **Why:** Emphasizes real-world relevance.
- **Base Urgency Score:** Default score applied to new or unsolved problems.
   - **Why:** Encourages initial focus on neglected areas.
- **Hints and Attempt Penalties:** Adjust scores for over-reliance on hints or repeated attempts.
   - **Why:** Drives better problem-solving habits.

## Using --help

The `--help` flag is available for all CLI commands to guide users through usage and options. For example:

### Global Help:
```sh
python cli.py --help
```
Displays a summary of all available commands and their purpose.

### Command-Specific Help:
View options and descriptions for a specific command:
```sh
python cli.py problem add --help
```
Provides detailed guidance for using the `add` subcommand under `problem`.

### Interactive Prompts:
For commands like `add` and `today`, users are guided through prompts to input required data.

**Tip:** Always use `--help` if unsure about a command's syntax or options. It ensures correct usage and prevents errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Resolutions

#### Database Not Found:
Ensure `config.ini` has the correct path:
```ini
db_path = leetcode_mastery.db
```
Reinitialize if necessary:
```sh
python db_init.py
```

#### Dependencies Missing:
Install required libraries:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Visualization Issues:
Ensure `matplotlib` is installed:
```sh
pip install matplotlib
```

#### CLI Command Errors:
Verify correct syntax and parameters:
```sh
python cli.py --help
```
